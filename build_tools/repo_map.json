    "structure_hint": "Server repo is a Rails monolith. Routes are wired in config/routes.rb and point into app/controllers (v1 is the JSON API surface; controller filenames are plural *_controller.rb and generally map to resources). API resources live in app/resources/v1 (JSONAPI::Resources-style classes) with filenames *_resource.rb; they usually mirror controller/model names and define attributes, relationships, and filtering. Authorization is handled in app/policies with *_policy.rb; domain data/persistence is in app/models with filenames matching the class. Business logic is split across app/services (orchestrators), app/queries (read/query objects), app/validators (custom validation), and app/processors/formatters/value_formatters for data shaping. Background jobs run in app/workers (Sidekiq). Notifications and outbound messaging live in app/mailers, app/txters, and app/notifiers. Shared framework/extensions can live in lib; schema snapshots live in db/structure_split. Specs are in spec/controllers, spec/requests, spec/resources, spec/policies, spec/models, spec/services, spec/serializers, spec/queries, spec/validators, and spec/workers; they often show expected params, permission outcomes, and validations. To trace an endpoint: routes.rb -> controller -> resource -> policy -> model/service."
