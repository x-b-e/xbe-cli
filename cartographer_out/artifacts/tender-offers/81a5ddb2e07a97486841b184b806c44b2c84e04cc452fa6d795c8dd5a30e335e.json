Tender must have job schedule shifts present. Tender must have rates, including required service type unit of measures. Customer tenders require the job to have a quantified unit of measure (e.g., hour, ton, tolls, load). Broker tenders must be related to an accepted customer tender on the job. Job must match trucker billing requirement (bills_broker forbids management rate; bills_customer requires it). If the customer requires job production plans, the job must have one. Buyer and seller compliance validations are enforced unless skip certification validation is set.",
