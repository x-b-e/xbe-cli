  "description": "Update a project transport plan driver confirmation.",
  "permissions": "Admins can update any confirmation. Non-admins can update only when the confirmation was pending, the record has a trucker, and either the user is the confirmation driver and a member of that trucker, or the user is practically a trucker manager for that trucker (broker member or trucker manager).",
  "side_effects": "Status changes can update the linked project transport plan driver (confirm -> status active; reject/expire -> unassign driver) and may unset associated tractors for matching segments. Changing confirm-at max on a pending confirmation schedules an expiration job. Adding a note appends a timestamped note entry to the confirmation notes.",
  "validation_notes": "id argument is required. At least one of --status, --note, or --confirm-at-max must be provided. status must be one of: pending, confirmed, rejected, expired, superseded. confirm-at-max must be an ISO 8601 timestamp.",
